            <p class="sectionTag text-small">Study abroad organizations, also referred to as study abroad providers,
                and third-party study abroad providers are independent organizations that facilitate or administer
                study abroad programs. Providers of study abroad vary enormously in terms of organizational structure,
                program model and type, and services offered to the participants.

                Given the tremendous growth in the number of U.S. students studying abroad over the last two decades,
                the study abroad industry has become more crowded and competitive in recent years. The study abroad
                business has traditionally been a cottage industry with a hodgepodge of domestic and foreign
                universities,
                for-profit and non-profit independent organizations providing thousands of programs in more than 100
                countries.
                Some, like the Danish Institute for Study Abroad, offer their own programs, with their own courses and
                curricular
                expectations. Others, like the Institute for the International Education of Students (IES) and The
                College of
                Global Studies at Arcadia University, offer some of their own programs, but also are known for acting as
                intermediaries—offering student services, plus a quality control stamp, for those students enrolling in
                foreign universities who want more of a cushion than what's available when they directly enroll through
                international student offices abroad.

                According to the Institute of International Education, the majority of U.S. college students studying
                abroad,
                about 72 percent, participate on programs sponsored by their home institution. However, at least 28
                percent
                of the approximately 260,000 Americans who studied abroad in academic year 2008/09 study through an
                outside
                program.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-small">Outside providers like IES and The College of Global Studies at Arcadia
                University
                act as intermediaries by assisting program participants with logistics like course registration and
                housing
                arrangements. While models differ, academic and social guidance is generally included throughout the
                duration
                of a program, such as orientation, support services, field trips and cultural activities. Additionally,
                providers are typically able to provide transcripts that ease credit transfer for students who enroll
                in their programs based at universities abroad – offer all these extra services, of course, at an extra
                cost.
                Independent providers, like Help Me Abroad, offer solutions to adapt to international students’
                requests.
                They act as intermediaries and allow a wider choice for students who can pick the state, university and
                program to attend instead of applying to premade programs.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-small">At many campuses, study abroad programs are run by multiple companies and
                non-profit
                institutes that offer colleges generous incentives to increase enrollments. An influential article that
                appeared
                in The New York Times in 2007 highlighted that this can include free and subsidized travel overseas for
                officials,
                back-office services to defray operating expenses, stipends to market the programs to students, unpaid
                membership
                on advisory councils and boards, and even cash bonuses and commissions on student-paid fees. This money
                generally
                goes directly to colleges, not always to the students who take the trips.

                Critics say that these and similar arrangements, which are seldom disclosed, typically limit student
                options and
                drive up prices for gaining international credentials compared with the most economical alternative —
                enrolling
                directly in a foreign university, paying generally lower tuition to that institution and having the
                credits
                transferred. Some campuses require students to use one of several affiliated providers, but some even
                have exclusive
                arrangements with study abroad agents, further limiting options.</p>
